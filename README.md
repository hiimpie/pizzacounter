# Pizza Counter

Using the power of ChatGPT I have crafted the most handful thing that ever existed ever...
The Pizza Counter!

# Installation n running the thing
First of course you need python, if you dont got that, then im sorry but the rest is gonna be pointless for you.

Second we need to install somethings:
`pip install flask`
`pip install pynput`
`pip install Thread`
`pip install keyboard`

Okay, now go run the script!

To enable/disable the counter, press `p` for pizza.

If theres any issues or errors like too much pizza, sorry but i can't help you, this was made for one dumb stream and thats quite literally it.
Enjoy it and enjoy some pizza, you pizza lovers!
